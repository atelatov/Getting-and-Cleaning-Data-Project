# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
This is my end-of-course project for Getting and Cleaning Data.

The R script run_analysis.R does the following: 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Note on data: the original data was downloaded from the coursera course website and saved in one of the author's local directories. Anyone who wishes to run this code must download the data and provide their own read-in statements.

The code is fully commented.
